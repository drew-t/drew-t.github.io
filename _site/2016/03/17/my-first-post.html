<h2>On Testing and TDD</h2>
<h4>A little background first might help:</h4>
<p>I went to college and got a degree in Informatics. It doesn’t matter too much what exactly that is, but it is computer-science-y. I had 2 programming classes after which I didn’t ever feel confident in actually being able to make something, but I understood the basics. Never heard of testing.</p>
<h4>Now to pre-work for Turing:</h4>
<p>Doing Pragmatic Studio they were doing this thing called TDD and testing. I could tell what they were doing, but I didn’t really understand its purpose. I just kind of went with it and typed what they told me. (Which was about the only thing to do with Pragmatic Studio.)</p>
<h4>So off I went to school at Turing:</h4>
<p>The first project we did in Echo was Mastermind. They didn’t require any testing for this. Obviously in order to write a program in a language you only slightly know you have to test somehow… Well the best way I knew was to either run the program and test something specifically or put in puts statements and see what it gave me back. This was basically how I had learned to test/debug when writing Python in school and that’s how I did it now, too.</p>
<p>I think writing tests and running them on your code, especially when you go back to modify/update/refactor/etc… is so useful that I can’t believe I didn’t know about it before I came here. Learning to code in different venues, it had never even been brought up as a thing people do. Let alone was it taught or suggested that we try to learn it or do it.</p>
<h4>So testing is cool, TDD on the other hand:</h4>
<p>I struggle on a constant basis trying to write tests before I write my code. I’m not entirely sure why… I understand the usefulness and they way in which writing the test can make you think through the needed method more thoroughly. I just can’t do it as hard as I try.</p>
<p>When I’m faced with a problem my first instinct is to start solving that problem. I am trying to overcome this and I welcome and comments, suggestions, or people who feel the same way.</p>
